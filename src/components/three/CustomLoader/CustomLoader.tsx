        These oil-stained pages recount the tales of the Fallen,
        a frayed empire, words without warmth. The hearth
        has ebbed, its gleam and life's sparks are but memories
        against dimming eyes â€“ what cast my mind, what hue my
        thoughts as I open the Book of the Fallen
        and breathe deep the scent of history?
        Listen, then, to these words carried on that breath.
        These tales are the tales of us all, again yet again.
        We are history relived and that is aft, without end that is all."`
