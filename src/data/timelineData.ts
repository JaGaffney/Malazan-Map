The figure, described as an expressionless, decayed apparition, questions Cotillion's audacity. Cotillion asserts his disbelief in failure and his indifference to others' beliefs about his success or failure. Despite Edgewalker's skepticism and the suggestion that Cotillion cannot win, Cotillion remains defiant, suggesting that not winning doesn't necessarily equate to losing. The passage conveys a tense exchange, highlighting Cotillion's resolve and the eerie presence of Edgewalker.",
